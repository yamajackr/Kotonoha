==========

Kotonoha is an Anki add-on that can be used to automatically add pronunciation, definition, and other relevant information to words in the Anki editor. This tool simplifies the process of adding information to flashcards, making it easier for users to create high-quality study materials. With this add-on, users can focus on learning the material rather than spending time looking up definitions and pronunciations.

Only tested on Anki 2.1.6.

**Note:** This add-on uses Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ®, Medical, Learner's, and Elementary Dictionary with Audio API to get definitions and pronunciations. This requires you sign up for a Merriam-Webster account and use your own individual API access key. Go to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary API website](http://www.dictionaryapi.com/), sign up for an account, and request access to the dictionaries. Then, replace **`YOUR_KEY_HERE`** with the key you receive. You can add up to three dictionaries. Also, the add-on references the English-Japanese dictionary provided by [Weblio](https://ejje.weblio.jp/).

## How to use
First, set up the add-on's configuration settings. This requires entering your primary dictionary and API key for that dictionary. You can also choose to include additional dictionaries if you wish.

Once the add-on is configured, you can use it to search for the pronunciation and definitions of a word by pressing the button in the flashcard creation window. Simply select the word you want to look up (or use all the text on the front of the card), and the add-on will automatically search for and display the information you need.
