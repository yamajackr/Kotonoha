==========
<img align="right" src="Kotonoha/images/leaf_green.png" width="372" height="256">

Kotonoha is an Anki add-on that can be used to automatically add pronunciation, definition, and other relevant information to words in the Anki editor. This tool simplifies the process of adding information to flashcards, making it easier for users to create high-quality study materials. With this add-on, users can focus on learning the material rather than spending time looking up definitions and pronunciations.

Only tested on Anki 2.1.6.

**Note:** This add-on uses Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ®, Medical, Learner's, Elementary Dictionary with Audio API to get definitions and pronunciations. This requires you sign up for a Merriam-Webster account and use your own individual API access key. Go to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary API website](http://www.dictionaryapi.com/), sign up for an account, and request access to the dictionaries. Then, replace **`YOUR_KEY_HERE`** with the key you receive. You can add up to three dictionaries. Also, the add-on references the English-Japanese dictionary provided by [Weblio](https://ejje.weblio.jp/).
